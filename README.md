# First Project Integrating Multiple Technologies

This project marks my first experience integrating various technologies, focusing on back-end development and database management, using **Flask** as the web framework and **PostgreSQL** as the database system. Although this is a simple project in terms of functionality, the development process was highly enriching and provided me with significant learning on technology integration.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Used as the main framework for developing the web application. It managed the routes and the logic of interaction with the RESTful API.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database system chosen for this project. I spent several hours configuring PostgreSQL, from setting up the database to correctly connecting it with the API. The challenge of linking an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to the Flask application gave me in-depth knowledge of how to manage data in a production environment.
- **RESTful API**: I developed an API with routes for **GET**, **POST**, and **DELETE**, allowing for efficient and organized interaction between the front-end and the database. Each route was carefully designed to adhere to best API development practices.
- **cru.js**: During my research on dynamic iterations for the application's interface, I discovered the **cru.js** library, which was crucial in creating a more responsive front-end experience. Integrating this library made the application more interactive, enhancing the user experience.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge in this project was configuring and integrating the PostgreSQL database with Flask. I spent considerable time learning about PostgreSQLâ€™s structure and functionality, as well as how to use an ORM to facilitate data access more efficiently. This effort resulted in an API that not only performs basic database operations but also follows best practices in security and performance.

Another challenge was working with **cru.js**, which added a layer of complexity to the front-end development. The library helped me create a more dynamic application and provided an excellent opportunity to delve deeper into JavaScript and client-side data manipulation.

## Conclusion

This project was an excellent opportunity to consolidate my knowledge of full-stack development and the integration of various technologies. While simple, it was crucial in helping me deepen my understanding of concepts such as front-end and back-end communication, database management, and the importance of API architecture. Moreover, it laid a solid foundation for more complex projects in the future.
